"# Hackathon Project Knowledge Base

## 1. Problem Statement
Develop a lightweight, FHIR R4–compliant terminology microservice that integrates India’s NAMASTE (Ayurveda/Siddha/Unani) codes with WHO ICD‑11 (Traditional Medicine Module 2 and Biomedicine), enabling dual coding within EMR Problem Lists. The service must expose FHIR terminology operations for search and translation, synchronize ICD‑11 content via the WHO ICD‑API, and provide a secure FHIR Bundle upload interface—aligned with India’s EHR Standards and ABDM (ABHA‑linked) security expectations.[1][2][3]

## 2. Background & Context
- ICD‑11 is WHO’s global diagnostic standard with a digital API and canonical URIs; Chapter 26 includes Traditional Medicine modules enabling traditional diagnoses to be recorded alongside biomedicine for care, claims, and analytics.[4][3][1]
- FHIR defines standardized REST operations and resource models (CodeSystem, ValueSet, ConceptMap, Condition) that power terminology workflows such as autocomplete ($expand), code details ($lookup), validation, and translation ($translate).[5][2]
- India’s ABDM provides ABHA identity and sandbox environments for secure health data exchange, informing a production path for OAuth‑secured APIs and consented shares.[6][7][8]

Why this matters:
- Dual coding links traditional medicine diagnoses to globally recognized ICD‑11 codes, unlocking insurance claims, continuity of care, and national reporting without losing traditional context.[3][4]

## 3. Key Standards & References
- WHO ICD‑11
    - ICD‑API v2 (OAuth, API‑Version header v2; entity URIs function as API endpoints).[1]
    - ICD‑11 portal and browser resources for terminology content.[4]
- FHIR Terminology Services
    - Core ops: $expand, $lookup, $validate‑code, $subsumes, $translate.[2][5]
    - ValueSet $expand parameters and behavior (filters, paging).[9]
- India ABDM / ABHA
    - ABDM Sandbox and ABHA Number Service documentation (integration milestones).[7][8][6]
- Implementation/usage exemplars
    - DHIS2 ICD‑11 app integration and data flow with ICD‑11 API.[10]
    - Firely .NET SDK ExternalTerminologyService usage ($expand).[11]

## 4. Challenges in Integration
- Lack of public, fully curated NAMASTE↔ICD‑11 crosswalks; mappings must be curated, versioned, and governed.[2]
- ICD‑11 release cadence and URIs require version-aware sync and cache to maintain currency and stability.[1]
- EMR vendor variability: need a standard FHIR facade to minimize integration friction while preserving performance.[2]
- Security and consent: ABDM alignment demands OAuth‑secured endpoints now and ABHA‑linked flows in production.[6][7]

## 5. Proposed Solution Overview
A terminology microservice exposing:
- Autocomplete/search with ValueSet $expand (combined NAMASTE + ICD‑11 suggestions).[5][2]
- Code details with CodeSystem $lookup (term, definition, multilingual designations).[12][5]
- Translation with ConceptMap $translate (NAMASTE → ICD‑11 TM2/Biomed) including equivalence metadata and provenance.[5]
- WHO ICD‑11 API sync (OAuth client credentials, API‑Version v2) to fetch entities by URI, with caching and release tagging.[13][1]
- Minimal Condition write to store dual‑coded Problem List entries for demo (one diagnosis with both systems).[14]

Security, observability, provenance:
- HTTPS endpoints with bearer token (MVP), roadmap to ABHA OAuth in production.[7][6]
- Prometheus metrics (RED) and a basic Grafana dashboard for latency/error visibility during demo.[15]
- “About” endpoint exposing NAMASTE/ConceptMap versions and last ICD‑11 release/etag seen.[1]

## 6. Detailed Technical Implementation Plan

### 6.1 Backend (Services and Ops)
- Terminology Service (read‑optimized)
    - GET /ValueSet/$expand?filter=… returns suggestions from local NAMASTE value set plus cached ICD‑11 keywords.[9][2]
    - GET /CodeSystem/$lookup?system=…&code=… returns display/definition/designations.[12][5]
    - Performance: in‑memory + shared cache for hot terms. Metrics: requests/sec, error rate, histogram latency.[15]

- Translation Service (mapping logic)
    - POST /ConceptMap/$translate with NAMASTE system+code → returns ICD‑11 target URIs and equivalence.[5]
    - If no local ConceptMap hit, suggest candidates via WHO ICD entity lookups (cached) and mark “review required.”[1]

- WHO ICD‑11 Sync
    - OAuth client‑credentials token acquisition.[13]
    - Resolve entities by URI, cache JSON, record last release/etag.[1]
    - Background refresh without blocking clinician calls.

- Encounter/Condition Writer (MVP)
    - POST /Condition with dual code.coding entries (NAMASTE + ICD‑11), subject, onset.[14]
    - GET /Condition?patient=… to list saved problems.[14]

- Security (MVP → Prod)
    - MVP: static bearer token over TLS; Production: ABHA‑linked OAuth through ABDM flows (milestones M1+).[6][7]

- Observability
    - /metrics (Prometheus): RED per endpoint; Grafana dashboard JSON provided.[15]

### 6.2 Data Model and Content
- CodeSystem (NAMASTE): canonical URL, version, concept[] with display/definition/designations.[12]
- ConceptMap: NAMASTE → ICD‑11 with equivalence (equivalent/related‑to/narrower/broader) and comments/provenance.[5]
- ValueSet: union/filterable sets for NAMASTE and ICD‑11 to drive $expand.[2]
- Condition: one diagnosis with multiple codings for dual coding on Problem List.[14]

### 6.3 API Contracts (Illustrative)

ValueSet $expand
- GET /ValueSet/$expand?filter=grah&count=10 → ValueSet.expansion.contains[].system, code, display.[9]

CodeSystem $lookup
- GET /CodeSystem/$lookup?system={NAMASTE}&code=ASU‑GI‑001 → Parameters with display/definition/designations.[12][5]

ConceptMap $translate
- POST /ConceptMap/$translate {system, code} → Parameters with match[].equivalence + concept(system=http://id.who.int/icd/entity, code=URI, display=title).[5]

WHO ICD‑API usage
- GET https://id.who.int/icd/entity/{id} with Authorization: Bearer <token>, API‑Version: v2.[13][1]

### 6.4 Minimal UI
- Single-page app:
    - Search box → calls $expand with filter.
    - Term details → calls $lookup for NAMASTE term.
    - Translate → calls $translate and shows ICD‑11 targets + equivalence.
    - Save → POST /Condition; list saved problems.

### 6.5 Security & Compliance Posture
- TLS everywhere, bearer for MVP; plan for ABHA OAuth scopes and consent artifacts on production flows (documented in README).[7][6]
- No PHI beyond a demo patient; focus on code-path security and auditability.

## 7. MVP Features & Deliverables (48‑hour build)
- Autocomplete diagnosis search via ValueSet $expand (combined NAMASTE + ICD‑11 suggestions).[9][2]
- Code details via $lookup (display, definition, designations).[12]
- One‑click translation NAMASTE → ICD‑11 via $translate with equivalence metadata.[5]
- Minimal WHO integration: OAuth token and 2–3 entity URI resolves (cached) to prove live linkage.[13][1]
- Save dual‑coded diagnosis (Condition) and list them for a demo patient.[14]
- “About” endpoint: show NAMASTE/ConceptMap versions and last WHO release/etag.[1]
- Basic security (demo bearer) and TLS; README notes ABHA OAuth mapping.[6][7]
- Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboard for RED per endpoint.[15]

Seed content:
- NAMASTE CodeSystem JSON with ~30–50 demo concepts; ConceptMap JSON/CSV for top mappings (e.g., Grahani, Jwara, Bhrama).[16][17]

## 8. Future Scope / Scalability
- Full ABHA OAuth and consent manager (HIE‑CM) integration for inter‑facility exchanges.[18][6]
- Broader ICD‑11 coverage and automated sync jobs; post‑coordination aids for ICD‑11 coding rules.[1][5]
- Authoring UI and governance for ConceptMap curation (review workflows, provenance, version diff).[2]
- Performance hardening: shared cache, JSONB/Postgres indexes, horizontal scaling, and shard strategies for national rollout.
- SMART on FHIR app packaging to plug into EMRs, and expanded analytics exports.

## 9. Demo Flow (for judges)
1) Type “grah” → $expand suggestions show NAMASTE “Grahani” + ICD‑11 items.[9][2]
2) Click “Grahani” → $lookup shows definition/designations.[12]
3) Click “Translate” → $translate returns ICD‑11 TM2 target with equivalence and display.[5]
4) Save Problem → Condition with dual coding persisted; list shows both codes.[14]
5) Show “About” (versions, last WHO release) and Grafana panel (latency/errors) as operational proof.[15][1]

## 10. Appendix: Useful References (for developers)
- ICD‑11 API v2 docs, OAuth, URI endpoints.[13][1]
- FHIR Terminology services and operations.[9][2][5]
- ABHA/ABDM Sandbox docs (onboarding, health ID flows).[8][7][6]
- DHIS2 ICD‑11 app integration overview (pattern/example).[10]
- Firely SDK example calling $expand (client usage pattern).[11]
- ICD‑11 general info and update context (TM2 inclusion).[3][4]"

now i want to make a react+tailwind css frontend that will connect to my springboot backend,
-> Generate me a detailed prompt that will make claude list all the details of my backend, that i could feed my model while generating frontend, this should contains api understanding, and use cases, with context to problem statement and etc,
-> think deeply, understand my message, add something from your side too,
# NOTE:
-> I will generate frontend visuals in another prompt, no need to do it in this, however a little guidance wont mind.
